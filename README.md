# controlUp Project - Reut Mazurik

In these two projects, I used Python with Playwright and Pytest frameworks. I focused on using the POM approach to make the tests more flexible and easier to maintain. Each project has a small README file with details and instructions.

A couple of things to remember:

Playwright for Python: You'll need to install Playwright for Python in order to run the tests. The README files explain how to set it up.

API Tests: Before running the API tests, make sure to update the email and password in the config files as mentioned in the README.

Thanks!
